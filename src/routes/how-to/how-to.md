# How To Guide

These assets are created for use in a [threlte](https://threlte.xyz/) project. Browse for assets you want to use, then click copy and paste into a new component.

If you'd like to copy a ton of components, you can either go to the [github repo](https://github.com/DefinitelyMaybe/FunBit) of this site or download the [original assets](https://quaternius.com/index.html) and run them through the [gltf package](https://threlte.xyz/docs/reference/gltf/getting-started) yourself.

The copied component points to assets in this site but if you'd like to have them locally, you can download them by navigating to the addresses in the component within your browser. Alternatively, copy-paste from the [github repo](https://github.com/DefinitelyMaybe/FunBit) or download the [original assets](https://quaternius.com/index.html).

On a project thats important to you, it's best to have the assets within your project instead of linking to this site. I'll try not to break links but there is no guarantee as that might need to happen in the future.

## Quickstart

If you're new to threlte, I'd recommend reading the [docs](https://threlte.xyz/docs/learn/getting-started/introduction). There's a lot of good information and even an AI assistant, just click the `search` button top right.

## About

The components are the output of the [gltf package](https://threlte.xyz/docs/reference/gltf/getting-started), plus some adjustments to load textures correctly where applicable.

This site serves as an easy way to get assets without over-commiting, letting you iterate on whats really important to you.
