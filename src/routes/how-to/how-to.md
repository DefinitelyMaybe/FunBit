# How To Guide

Browse for assets you want to use, then click copy and paste into a new
component.

If you'd like to copy a ton of components, you can either go to the
[github repo](https://github.com/DefinitelyMaybe/FunBit) of this site or
download the [original assets](https://quaternius.com/index.html) and run them
through the
[gltf package](https://threlte.xyz/docs/reference/gltf/getting-started)
yourself.

The copied component points to assets in this site but if you'd like to have
them locally, you can download them by navigating to the addresses in the
component within your browser. Alternatively, copy-paste from the
[github repo](https://github.com/DefinitelyMaybe/FunBit) or download the
[original assets](https://quaternius.com/index.html).

On a project thats important to you, it's best to have the assets within your
project instead of linking to this site. I'll try not to break links but there
is no guarantee as that might need to happen in the future.

## About

These are the free assets made by Quaternius. They've simply been processed for easier use in a [threlte](https://threlte.xyz/) project.

The components are the output of the
[gltf package](https://threlte.xyz/docs/reference/gltf/getting-started), plus
some adjustments (like loading textures) so they just work.

This site serves as an easy way to get assets without over-commiting, letting
you iterate faster.
